### üí° **Tips for Focus**

In my opinion, many students find **reading** difficult. If you're proficient in speaking English, I‚Äôd suggest focusing more on **reading** since it can be tricky at times. 

**Listening** and **writing** can be improved by giving a few practice tests, and for me, **speaking** was a bit of a hurdle since English isn't my first language.
