### üöÄ Step 1: Mock Test First

Before diving into preparation, I took a **mock test** to assess my level, understand where I stood, and identify which parts needed more attention. It also helped me get familiar with the user interface of the computer-based exam.

### üéØ **My IELTS Score**
My preparation lasted for 5 days, and I scored an **average of 7.5**:

- **Listening:** 8  
- **Reading:** 7.5  
- **Speaking:** 7.5  
- **Writing:** 6  
- **Overall Average:** 7.5

### üí° **Key Areas to Focus On**

In my experience, many students find the **reading** section to be challenging. If you're already confident in your English speaking skills, I'd recommend prioritizing **reading** practice, as it can be tricky at times.

**Listening** and **writing** can be improved through regular practice tests, while **speaking** was a bit of a hurdle for me, as English is not my first language.
